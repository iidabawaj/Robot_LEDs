# Robot_LEDs
Task 1 of the Electrical Engineering path

In part 1 of this task, I turned the LED on and off with a button.

I started by building an Arduino circuit using wires to connect the breadboard to the Arduino. Then, I plugged the LED and added a 220 Ohm resistor to limit the current going through the LED and to avoid burning the LED. After that, I plugged the push button into the breadboard and placed a 10k Ohm to act as a "pull-down" resistor making the default button state to be LOW.



In part 2 of this task, I created an 8 by 8 LED matrix.

At first, I started by creating an 8x8 matrix using LEDs and then binding adjacent LEDs together with a wire and connecting each row and column separately to the Arduino. To avoid burning the LEDs in the matrix, I added resistors at the button of each row.
